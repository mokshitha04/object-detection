# Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLOv4

This mini-project presents a real-time object detection system built using **YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once Version 4)**. YOLOv4 is a high-speed and accurate deep learning model for object detection. The main objective of this project is to develop a lightweight, efficient, and adaptable model that supports real-time object detection on both images and videos via a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
